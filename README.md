## ðŸ”§ Minor Changes
- updated placeholder texts and UI labels.
- removed unnecessary things (and stuff which didn't work out)
- no more blank cover arts!
          no song played will show gray buddy (at the start),
          and playing a song without a cover art will show blue buddy.

## ðŸ’» Code Changes
- modified index.html to include new metadata, manifest, and icons.
- tried to optimize ram usage (good luck chromebook users)

## How to use
To setup this webapp, you go into the website. (or open the index.html file if you downlaoded the code)
You will need to have a **folder** of songs, since songs aren't provided (yet?)
We recommend that the songs you have in a folder(s) **include metadata, like the title, artist name, album name, cover image, etc.**

After that you should be good to go! If you have songs with metadata (especially with cover image), we recommend going into settings and switching the theme to "Adaptive (Beta)"

Right-click on a song to add it to queue, add to favorites, save locally, or delete.

## Note
This web app is still in development, so if you see this, and if you encounter a bug, send in an Issue. (if you can)
