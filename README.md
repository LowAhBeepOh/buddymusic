# buddymusic
An offline music from the Buddy project / ecosystem

## How to use
To setup this webapp, you go into the website. (or open the index.html file if you downlaoded the code)
You will need to have a **folder** of songs, since songs aren't provided (yet?)
We recommend that the songs you have in a folder(s) **include metadata, like the title, artist name, album name, cover image, etc.**

After that you should be good to go! If you have songs with metadata (especially with cover image), we recommend going into settings and switching the theme to "Adaptive (Beta)"

## Note
This web app is still in development, so if you see this, and if you encounter a bug, send in an Issue. (if you can)
