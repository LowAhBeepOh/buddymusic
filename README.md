## How to use
To setup this webapp, you go into the website. (or open the index.html file if you downlaoded the code)
You will need to have a **folder** of songs, since songs aren't provided (yet?)
We recommend that the songs you have in a folder(s) **include metadata, like the title, artist name, album name, cover image, etc.**

After that you should be good to go! If you have songs with metadata (especially with cover image), we recommend going into settings and switching the theme to "Adaptive (Beta)"

Right-click on a song to add it to queue, add to favorites, save locally, or delete.

## Note
This web app is still in development, so if you see this, and if you encounter a bug, send in an Issue. (if you can)
