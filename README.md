# Buddy Music
An offline music player from the Buddy project/ecosystem.

## What's New - 0.XD (yes, I updated how the changelog is)

### ðŸ˜± This update's new feature!!!
A smart command tool!!!! :D
Hold down the period key for a little second, and a input box should appear, write stuff like "play (song)", "queue (artist)", "go to 2:30", "pause", "play", "next", "vol max", "theme (theme name)"
Still not in full development, but it will be done soon.

### Other cool features
- Bulk favoriting and deletion of songs (through search)
- Slider changes (for people who see a shitty slider because of school chromebooks)

### ðŸ‘… New Themes!!
- Added new "Nature" theme, light themed, green.
- Added new "Prep" theme, light themed, pink.
- Added new "Hackin'" theme, dark themed, looks like you're about to write "ping" in your console, while listening to white girl music.

### âš¡ Performance & Memory Improvements

- Implemented a better song manager (kinda works)

## How to Use

2. You will need a folder containing music files (songs are not provided)
3. Recommended: Use songs with metadata (title, artist name, album name, cover image)
4. After adding songs, try the "Adaptive" theme for dynamic colour effects based on album art
